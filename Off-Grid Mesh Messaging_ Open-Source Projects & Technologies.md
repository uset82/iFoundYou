# Off-Grid Mesh Messaging: Open-Source Projects & Technologies

When traditional telecom networks and power grids go down – such as in wars, earthquakes, or other disasters – **mesh networking** offers a way to communicate directly between devices without any internet or cell service[\[1\]](http://venturebeat.com/technology/were-approaching-the-post-internet-age-you-need-to-learn-about-mesh-networks#:~:text=Mesh%20networks%20are%20small%2C%20standalone,natural%20disaster%20or%20political%20suppression)[\[2\]](https://venturebeat.com/ai/no-internet-no-problem-this-app-lets-you-send-chats-offline-across-ios-android#:~:text=FireChat%20uses%20a%20technology%20called,according%20to%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20developer%20site). Mesh messaging apps create peer-to-peer links (via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) so that nearby smartphones form a local network and relay messages for each other. A famous early example was **FireChat**, which in 2014 let iOS and Android users chat "off-the-grid" by leveraging Apple’s Multipeer Connectivity (using peer-to-peer Wi‑Fi plus Bluetooth simultaneously) and a custom Android mesh protocol[\[2\]](https://venturebeat.com/ai/no-internet-no-problem-this-app-lets-you-send-chats-offline-across-ios-android#:~:text=FireChat%20uses%20a%20technology%20called,according%20to%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20developer%20site)[\[3\]](https://venturebeat.com/ai/no-internet-no-problem-this-app-lets-you-send-chats-offline-across-ios-android#:~:text=The%20Android%20app%20uses%20Open,support%20for%20Bluetooth%20peripheral%20mode). FireChat showed that devices could *“daisy-chain”* messages across multiple hops – each phone extending the range \~200 feet further – allowing texts to reach recipients far away (with slight latency) even when no internet was available[\[4\]](https://venturebeat.com/ai/no-internet-no-problem-this-app-lets-you-send-chats-offline-across-ios-android#:~:text=And%20while%20mesh%20networking%20has,claims%20it%27s%20not%20really%20noticeable). This capability proved invaluable during events like the 2014 Hong Kong protests, where FireChat enabled demonstrators to communicate despite government internet shutdowns[\[5\]](https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/3-messaging-apps-dont-rely-internet-connection-3667936#:~:text=FireChat%20became%20well,and%20coordination%20in%20challenging%20environments).

**Mesh networks** are essentially ad-hoc, decentralized local networks. Every device acts as both a client and a router, forwarding data for others[\[6\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=,stock%20up%20on%20power%20banks). The concept isn’t new – projects like Australia’s open-source *Serval Mesh* arose after the 2010 Haiti earthquake to let Android phones use Wi-Fi peer-to-peer for emergency calls and texts when towers were down[\[7\]](http://venturebeat.com/technology/were-approaching-the-post-internet-age-you-need-to-learn-about-mesh-networks#:~:text=The%20Serval%20project%20in%20Australia%2C,phones%20to%20hop%20between%20distances). Similarly, the **Commotion Wireless** project (by the Open Technology Institute) created secure Wi-Fi mesh networks for protestors to stay connected when regimes cut off the Internet[\[8\]](http://venturebeat.com/technology/were-approaching-the-post-internet-age-you-need-to-learn-about-mesh-networks#:~:text=The%20Commotion%20Wireless%20project%20of,protests%20in%20Egypt%20and%20elsewhere). These early initiatives confirmed that ordinary phones can form local networks of their own, though they faced challenges like limited range (\~100 meters between Wi-Fi nodes) and high battery usage[\[9\]](http://venturebeat.com/technology/were-approaching-the-post-internet-age-you-need-to-learn-about-mesh-networks#:~:text=structure%20that%20uses%20other%20phones,to%20hop%20between%20distances)[\[10\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=In%20the%202010s%2C%20with%20the,and%20even%20building%20new%20ones). Today, a new wave of mesh messaging apps is building on those lessons with improved tech and broader platform support.

## Open-Source Mesh Messaging Apps (No Internet Required)

Several projects on GitHub (and F-Droid) are actively exploring offline, peer-to-peer messaging. Below are some notable examples:

* **BitChat (2025)** – A fully decentralized, end-to-end encrypted chat app based on Bluetooth Low Energy mesh. BitChat was launched by a team including Jack Dorsey in 2025, positioning itself as a modern, IRC-like messenger for offline use[\[11\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=BitChat,it%20looks%20like%20one%20too). It sends messages in small 500-byte fragments for efficient transmission and requires no phone numbers or servers. BitChat runs on iOS and Android (open-sourced on GitHub) and can form multi-hop BLE networks to carry messages beyond direct Bluetooth range[\[11\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=BitChat,it%20looks%20like%20one%20too)[\[12\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=You%20can%20install%20the%20messenger,on%20Jack%20Dorsey%E2%80%99s%20X%20account). *Note:* Early security audits did find some vulnerabilities (the code was initially AI-generated “vibe coding”), but the developers have been patching these issues[\[13\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=However%2C%20security%20researchers%20have%20already,the%20bugs%20in%20upcoming%20updates)[\[14\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=principles%20at%20the%20app%E2%80%99s%20design,the%20bugs%20in%20upcoming%20updates). BitChat’s emergence underscores renewed interest in mesh texting – it’s even listed as a top alternative to Bridgefy by community sites[\[15\]](https://alternativeto.net/software/bridgefy/#:~:text=messenger%20in%20the%20social%20%26,12%20and%20Ricochet%20Refresh)[\[16\]](https://alternativeto.net/software/bridgefy/#:~:text=1).

* **Bridgefy** – One of the most popular offline messaging apps (though *not* open-source), included here for context. Bridgefy uses Bluetooth to form a mesh and reportedly has over 12 million downloads[\[17\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=Bridgefy,you%E2%80%99ll%20be%20able%20to%20connect). It works on iOS and Android with two main modes: person-to-person messaging and a broadcast mode to shout messages to any Bridgefy users nearby[\[18\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=connect)[\[19\]](https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/3-messaging-apps-dont-rely-internet-connection-3667936#:~:text=Bridgefy%2C%20another%20app%20leveraging%20Bluetooth,Bridgefy%20users%2C%20similar%20to%20FireChat). In “mesh” mode, messages hop through intermediate users, extending reach similarly to FireChat[\[19\]](https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/3-messaging-apps-dont-rely-internet-connection-3667936#:~:text=Bridgefy%2C%20another%20app%20leveraging%20Bluetooth,Bridgefy%20users%2C%20similar%20to%20FireChat). Bridgefy gained fame during events like the 2017 Mexico City earthquake, where people used it to coordinate when cell networks failed[\[20\]](https://www.thedailystar.net/tech-startup/news/3-messaging-apps-dont-rely-internet-connection-3667936#:~:text=This%20app%20has%20gained%20traction,communication%20when%20traditional%20networks%20fail). However, being proprietary, its security is harder to verify, and researchers have previously flagged encryption weaknesses. The free app also shows ads and can be unstable at times[\[18\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=connect).

* **Briar** – An open-source messenger focused on robust **security** and offline capability. Briar is Android-only[\[21\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=Finally%2C%20Briar%20is%20only%20available,for%20Android) and was built with activists and journalists in mind. It forgoes servers entirely: messages are stored only on users’ devices and synced directly via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct when peers are nearby[\[22\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=Briar.%20This%20is%20an%20open,security%20audit%20by%20Germany%E2%80%99s%20Cure53). If an internet connection is available, Briar can also sync through the Tor network for anonymity[\[23\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20working%20via,it%20a%20more%20versatile%20tool). Importantly, Briar’s code has undergone an independent security audit (Cure53) and implements strong end-to-end encryption[\[22\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=Briar.%20This%20is%20an%20open,security%20audit%20by%20Germany%E2%80%99s%20Cure53). The trade-offs are that Briar only supports basic text chatting (no images, voice, or GIFs) and contacts must be added in person (by QR code scan or by exchanging links out-of-band)[\[24\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=While%20Briar%20provides%20the%20highest,Briar%20only%20supports%20text%20messaging). Despite these limits, Briar excels at private, censorship-resistant communication in truly offline scenarios.

* **Berty** – A ambitious open-source project aiming for *offline-first* messaging with cross-platform support. Berty’s tagline is a messenger that works “with or without internet access, cellular data or trust in the network”[\[25\]](https://github.com/berty/berty#:~:text=Berty%20is%20a%20secure%20peer,or%20trust%20in%20the%20network). Under the hood it uses its own protocol (built on libp2p) and can fall back to BLE and local Wi-Fi (mDNS) to discover and connect directly to nearby peers when no internet is present[\[26\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/l67i0g/berty_a_secure_peertopeer_messaging_app_that/#:~:text=From%20the%20link). Like others, it forms an encrypted mesh where any device can forward messages – so with enough participating nodes, a Berty message could hop long distances to its destination[\[27\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/l67i0g/berty_a_secure_peertopeer_messaging_app_that/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20%205y%20ago). Berty is still evolving but has mobile apps for Android and iOS in development (it’s already on the iOS App Store)[\[28\]](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/berty-messenger/id1535500412#:~:text=Berty%20Messenger%20,for%20free%2C%20and%20avoid). Its focus is on strong privacy (minimizing metadata, no central server) similar to Briar, but with a friendlier interface and support for online operation too. Berty’s approach shows that offline p2p messaging can be integrated with modern networking stacks to give a seamless experience whether or not you have Internet.

* **Serval Mesh (BatPhone)** – An earlier open-source project enabling infrastructure-free calling and texting on Android. Serval (developed at Flinders University) allowed Android phones to form a Wi-Fi mesh network for voice calls, SMS, and file sharing without SIM cards or towers[\[29\]](https://www.flinders.edu.au/about/making-a-difference/serval-project#:~:text=Serval%20Mesh%20is%20a%20software,voice%2C%20text%20and%20data%20services)[\[30\]](https://github.com/servalproject/batphone#:~:text=servalproject%2Fbatphone%3A%20The%20Serval%20Mesh%20app,SMS%20and%20file%20sharing). It used a store-and-forward system (“MeshMS”) and could work over Wi-Fi even if Android didn’t support true ad-hoc mode (they developed a Mesh Extender hardware to bridge distances)[\[7\]](http://venturebeat.com/technology/were-approaching-the-post-internet-age-you-need-to-learn-about-mesh-networks#:~:text=The%20Serval%20project%20in%20Australia%2C,phones%20to%20hop%20between%20distances). Although innovative – Serval proved two phones can reach \~100 m via peer-to-peer Wi-Fi and more with dedicated extenders[\[9\]](http://venturebeat.com/technology/were-approaching-the-post-internet-age-you-need-to-learn-about-mesh-networks#:~:text=structure%20that%20uses%20other%20phones,to%20hop%20between%20distances) – the project had limited adoption and primarily remained a research effort. It’s a noteworthy predecessor that influenced newer apps (for example, Briar’s developers credit Serval).

* **Other Projects:** There are many more experimental apps and protocols. **Babble** (a 2018 hackathon project) used Android’s Nearby Connections API (which can leverage Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and even ultrasonic audio) to create a multi-hop mesh, and cleverly let users *install* the app offline via NFC tap (Android Beam) to spread the network in a disaster[\[31\]](https://github.com/aneekm/Babble#:~:text=Offline%20Install%20%26%20Setup)[\[32\]](https://github.com/aneekm/Babble#:~:text=Offline%20Send). The **Reticulum** network stack is an open-source framework for resilient comms: for instance, its MeshChat app can send encrypted messages, files, and even *voice calls* over whatever interfaces are available – local Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or long-range radio like LoRa – and will auto-route traffic over any mix of links[\[33\]](https://github.com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat#:~:text=,be%20decrypted%20by%20the%20intended)[\[34\]](https://github.com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat#:~:text=,running%20via%20the%20command%20line). Projects like **Sideband** and **Nomadnet** use Reticulum’s protocol (LXMF) to enable delay-tolerant messaging and distributed forums, showing the potential for a true “network of last resort” that goes beyond just phone-to-phone chat[\[35\]](https://github.com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat#:~:text=,hosted%20on%20%20105%20nodes)[\[36\]](https://github.com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat#:~:text=,messages%20from%20LXMF%20Propagation%20Nodes). While these are more complex and may require special hardware or command-line setup, they illustrate the *depth* of innovation happening in off-grid communication technology.

* **Meshtastic (LoRa Mesh)** – A unique open-source solution that combines smartphones with inexpensive long-range radios. Meshtastic lets you use small **LoRa** transceivers (low-power modules using license-free radio bands) to send text and GPS coordinates over distances **several kilometers** – far beyond Bluetooth/Wi-Fi range[\[37\]](https://github.com/meshtastic#:~:text=Meshtastic%C2%AE%20is%20a%20project%20that,optional%20GPS%20based%20location%20features). Each device (often a DIY gadget with a screen or a simple node) acts as a node in a mesh, relaying messages so that a group of users can stay in contact even if they are miles apart[\[38\]](https://github.com/meshtastic#:~:text=view%20text%20messages%20and%20enable,optional%20GPS%20based%20location%20features). Crucially, Meshtastic radios can pair to your phone (via Bluetooth) – the phone serves as a slick user interface to type messages and view chats/maps, while the LoRa device actually transmits the data off-grid. There are official apps for Android and iOS to connect your phone to Meshtastic hardware[\[39\]](https://github.com/meshtastic#:~:text=3.%20Meshtastic)[\[40\]](https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-Apple#:~:text=Meshtastic%20Apple%20Clients). This system has been likened to a civilian analog of military field radios or SATCOM texting devices, and indeed it’s popular among hikers, preppers, and search-and-rescue teams. Keep in mind that LoRa has very limited bandwidth (text-only, and a short message can take a few seconds to send), but it’s incredibly power-efficient and robust. Meshtastic demonstrates that with some extra hardware, your smartphone can communicate even *when all else fails*.

## Key Technical Considerations

Building or using an offline communication app involves important **trade-offs** in the realm of telecommunications:

* **Range and Relays:** Personal devices have limited radio range. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Direct typically cover about 30–100 meters in open conditions[\[6\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=,stock%20up%20on%20power%20banks) (often much less with obstacles). To reach further, your message must hop through intermediate nodes. Thus, a mesh app is only useful if there are other users (or fixed relay nodes) within range to forward your data[\[6\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=,stock%20up%20on%20power%20banks)[\[41\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=closer%20if%20there%E2%80%99s%20no%20direct,so%20only%20trust%20independent%20researchers). In practice, a dense mesh of users is needed to cover large distances – e.g. one study noted a chain of 10,000 devices could extend a FireChat network across a city[\[4\]](https://venturebeat.com/ai/no-internet-no-problem-this-app-lets-you-send-chats-offline-across-ios-android#:~:text=And%20while%20mesh%20networking%20has,claims%20it%27s%20not%20really%20noticeable). Sparse usage severely limits these apps’ reach.

* **Bandwidth and Content:** Off-grid links have lower data rates. Bluetooth LE mesh might handle only tens of kilobits per second, and LoRa is even slower (a few bytes per second), so most apps restrict to text messages (no large images or videos). This is a **trade-off** to achieve robustness; as one example, BitChat breaks messages into \~500-byte fragments to send smoothly over BLE[\[42\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=It%20claims%20to%20be%20completely,up%2C%20email%2C%20or%20phone%20number). High-bandwidth features like voice calls are typically only feasible on local Wi-Fi meshes or specialized codecs (Reticulum’s MeshChat managed a two-way voice call over LoRa by using an ultra-low-bitrate codec[\[34\]](https://github.com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat#:~:text=,running%20via%20the%20command%20line) – an impressive feat but with very limited audio quality).

* **Power Consumption:** Continuously running a peer-to-peer radio (Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) will drain a phone’s battery faster[\[43\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=friends%20to%20switch%20from%20their,Claiming%20to%20have%20it%20and). Mesh apps keep radios in discovery or routing mode, which is more intensive than normal idle smartphone use. In disaster scenarios with no power grid, this is critical – you should **carry backup power** (power banks or solar chargers) if you plan to rely on off-grid messaging[\[44\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=the%20further%20a%20message%20can,stock%20up%20on%20power%20banks). Efficient protocols and duty cycling can help, but users often report needing to charge more often when using apps like Bridgefy or Briar heavily[\[43\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=friends%20to%20switch%20from%20their,Claiming%20to%20have%20it%20and).

* **Platform Compatibility:** Not all operating systems expose the same mesh-friendly capabilities. Apple’s *Multipeer Connectivity* framework (iOS) seamlessly blends Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and will automatically form peer-to-peer Wi-Fi links between nearby iOS devices[\[2\]](https://venturebeat.com/ai/no-internet-no-problem-this-app-lets-you-send-chats-offline-across-ios-android#:~:text=FireChat%20uses%20a%20technology%20called,according%20to%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20developer%20site). Android, by contrast, supports Wi-Fi Direct and Bluetooth, but early on it lacked certain features (e.g. BLE peripheral mode on older versions) needed for symmetric mesh links[\[3\]](https://venturebeat.com/ai/no-internet-no-problem-this-app-lets-you-send-chats-offline-across-ios-android#:~:text=The%20Android%20app%20uses%20Open,support%20for%20Bluetooth%20peripheral%20mode). Cross-platform apps have to use the lowest common denominator – typically Bluetooth LE – to connect iOS and Android devices. This is exactly what Bridgefy and Berty do. The FireChat team noted that making iOS and Android FireChat interoperate was *“a tough nut to crack”*[\[45\]](https://venturebeat.com/ai/no-internet-no-problem-this-app-lets-you-send-chats-offline-across-ios-android#:~:text=support%20for%20Bluetooth%20peripheral%20mode) (they didn’t publicize their method, but it likely involved creative use of Wi-Fi hotspots or BLE). In short, an offline app developer must grapple with different APIs and sometimes write custom networking code on each platform.

* **Security and Privacy:** Without central servers, mesh messages must be encrypted end-to-end for privacy – otherwise, any relay device or eavesdropper could read your content. Many mesh messengers do claim encryption, but implementation quality varies[\[46\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=,to%20defend%20against%20malicious%20actors). **Open-source** projects are preferable here, as their encryption can be audited by experts[\[46\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=,to%20defend%20against%20malicious%20actors). Briar is a gold standard with published security audits, whereas early versions of Bridgefy had encryption flaws, and BitChat’s first release was found to have serious bugs (likely from using AI-generated code)[\[13\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=However%2C%20security%20researchers%20have%20already,the%20bugs%20in%20upcoming%20updates)[\[46\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=,to%20defend%20against%20malicious%20actors). Additionally, metadata privacy is a concern: a global adversary could theoretically map out a mesh by observing Bluetooth signals or note which devices are relaying for whom. Some apps (Briar, Berty) are designed to minimize metadata and not even require phone numbers or any user identity, to mitigate this risk[\[42\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=It%20claims%20to%20be%20completely,up%2C%20email%2C%20or%20phone%20number)[\[47\]](https://alternativeto.net/software/bridgefy/#:~:text=A%20secure%2C%20decentralized%2C%20peer,%E2%80%94%20just%20pure%20encrypted%20communication). Still, **operational security** is key – users are advised not to discuss highly sensitive info on these apps unless they trust the app’s security model, and to keep apps updated for the latest fixes[\[48\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=and%20their%20verification.%20,anything%20confidential%20in%20these%20apps).

* **Preparation and Use Cases:** Mesh messaging is **not a full replacement** for regular communication. These apps are best treated like emergency tools – great to have in a crisis, but slower and more limited than internet messengers[\[49\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=Mesh%20messaging%20apps%20aren%E2%80%99t%20a,don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20use%20it). It’s wise to **install and set them up in advance** (and help your contacts install them too), because during an outage you might not have the opportunity to download a new app or walk others through it[\[50\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=and%20be%20glad%20you%20normally,don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20use%20it). Many users keep apps like Briar or Bridgefy on their phones as a contingency, much like carrying a first-aid kit[\[49\]](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/mesh-messengers/54192/#:~:text=Mesh%20messaging%20apps%20aren%E2%80%99t%20a,don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20use%20it). Real-world use cases include music festivals or sports events (where cell coverage is overloaded), international travel in censorship-heavy regions, natural disaster response, or rural hikes beyond coverage. In extreme cases – say, widespread infrastructure collapse – a combo of short-range phone meshes and long-range radio links (like Meshtastic nodes or amateur radio networks) could be deployed to maintain regional communication when nothing else works.

In summary, **mesh networking via smartphones is an evolving field**, blending telecommunications and software in ingenious ways. Projects on GitHub are openly advancing the state of the art, from straightforward Bluetooth chat apps to sophisticated multi-interface networks. While constraints like range and power remain, the progress is notable: today we have apps that let you send an encrypted message to a friend a mile away *with no Internet at all*. For a developer or researcher “going deep” into this area, exploring these open-source projects is invaluable – they demonstrate practical solutions for off-grid messaging and highlight the challenges (and rewards) of decentralized telecom. In an emergency when regular comms are gone, your iPhone or Android, paired with the right app (and maybe a radio gadget), can indeed become a lifeline to communicate[\[37\]](https://github.com/meshtastic#:~:text=Meshtastic%C2%AE%20is%20a%20project%20that,optional%20GPS%20based%20location%20features)[\[4\]](https://venturebeat.com/ai/no-internet-no-problem-this-app-lets-you-send-chats-offline-across-ios-android#:~:text=And%20while%20mesh%20networking%20has,claims%20it%27s%20not%20really%20noticeable). The technologies discussed here – from peer-to-peer phone networks to LoRa meshes – form the toolkit by which we can **stay connected when the grid goes dark**.

## iFoundYou Emergency Mode Update (App Plan)

This addendum maps the research above to a concrete build plan for iFoundYou.

- Phone-only mode (no infrastructure): iOS uses Multipeer Connectivity for Bluetooth + peer-to-peer Wi-Fi links; Android uses BLE fallback for cross-platform compatibility. (Source: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity, accessed 2025-12-22)
- Mesh routing: store-and-forward with TTL, small payloads, and deduplication.
- Voice: push-to-talk clips as the default; optional single-hop live voice when a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi link is available.
- Location: Core Location fixes, compact packets, offline map packs or compass mode. (Source: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation, accessed 2025-12-22)
- Long-range: optional Meshtastic LoRa bridge for kilometer-scale text and GPS. (Source: https://github.com/meshtastic, accessed 2025-12-22)
- Safety: end-to-end encryption, signed messages, and opt-in Emergency Mode to control battery drain.
